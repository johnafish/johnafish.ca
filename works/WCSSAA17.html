<article><h1>WCSSAA 2017</h1>
<p>Last week on Wednesday, May 10 and Thursday, May 11, I competed in my final regional track and field meet--my final WCSSAA championship. Here's how it went down.</p>
<h3>The Day Before</h3>
<p>Tuesday, May 9. I went to relay practice with the school team to practice handoffs for the 4x100m. 3km warmup+full drills alongside about 6 handoffs (which are effectively 30m accels).</p>
<h3>Day One</h3>
<p>The first day started off on not a great note; I slept pretty poorly the night before, and was exhausted. I decided that I needed to rest and caffeinate.</p>
<p>I headed down to the Tims, grabbed a large earl grey and ate my lunch. I then grabbed a coffee, and headed back to the track.</p>
<p>My first race of the meet was the 400m. This was my first 400m in almost a year, and I had done literally 0 speed work on the track prior to this (and it showed). I think I ran 51.47, which isn't awful all things considered.</p>
<p>About 30 minutes later, I ran the 1500m. I won the 1500m by a big margin after taking out the first 600m in 1:32. The wind and cold and lactic in my legs told me to back off or face certain peril.</p>
<p>In day one, I took home 18 points (second in the 400, first in the 1500), which is exactly what I did last year.</p>
<h3>Day Two</h3>
<p>On the second day of the meet, I was again pretty tired (I don't know why, but I slept horribly both nights). I caffeinated again, decided to go with a V8 energy drink this time (because it's fruit juice, which is arguably way more yummy than coffee).</p>
<p>First event of the day was the 800m for me. The goal, given the wind and cold, was to just run a few hundred meters hard at the end of the race. I split 62 for my first 400m (LOL) and then hit a nice 57 with about a 41s 300m that included 100m of headwind. Overall, a decent negative split, and an easy win.</p>
<p>I followed up the 800m with a 4x100m, which we got disqualified from because my third leg dropped the baton (I was so excited to anchor, too), but I still ran the 100m because why not?</p>
<p>Concluding the meet, I ran the 4x400. I anchored the boys to our second consecutive 4x400m win, splitting a 50 high to pull away from second place by a large 30-40m gap on the second place (although there was some drama with me getting pushed around).</p>
<h3>The Awards</h3>
<p>I took home second individual with 28 points--the guy who beat me in the 400m, Owen Read, also won the 100m and 200m to pull off the perfect 30 point triple. Gotta respect it.</p>
<p>The team won Senior Boys, Overall Boys, and--for the very first time in my highschool career, taking it away from the 5x defending champions--we won the overall WCSSAA points title.</p>
<p>It was a pretty excellent 2 days, and I'm looking forward to the meets in the coming weeks.</p></article>
