    <article><br><h1>Goodness</h1><p>Goodness has been examined rather thoroughly in the past few ISU articles. If you haven't read them yet, I'd recommend doing so. You will need some of the background knowledge to fully understand this article.<br></p><h2>Ignorance</h2><p>We have already looked at what makes actions and character traits good. But what is the inverse of this? For actions, we look to actions which are ignorant. There are really three different types of ignorant actions:</p><p>1. Regretted Ignorance.</p><p>2. Raging Ignorance.</p><p>3. Ignorance of Choice.<br></p><h3>Regretted Ignorance</h3><p>Is an action which is immediately regretted but is done in ignorance. For example: if I am looking in another direction and accidentally step on someone's foot, I would regret it immediately. Therefore, regretted ignorance is involuntary ignorance and is not bad.<br></p><h3>Raging Ignorance</h3><p>Is an action in which the person who is performing the action is under the influence of rage or alcohol. In this case, the ignorance is not the action - as it can not be controlled under influence, but the circumstance leading up to it. Allowing oneself to become influenced by rage or alcohol means that you are allowing yourself to be ignorant and perform ignorant actions - even though you don't know exactly what they are. <br></p><h3>Ignorance of Choice</h3><p>To describe ignorance of choice, we quote Sir David Ross:<br></p><blockquote>"Action is voluntary, then, when (1) its origin is in the agent, and (2) he knows the circumstances in which the act is done.<br>Page 198, Aristotle<br></blockquote><p>That is to say that if the ignorance is stemming from you and you are aware of the circumstances, unlike the first two distinctions, you are fully responsible for the ignorance. And therefore, ignorance of choice is bad.<br></p><h2>Goodness of Character</h2><p>Goodness of character is living by the doctrine of the mean. Nothing in excess, nothing in defect. To get good, you do good, stemming initially from an involuntary act. Socrates argues with Aristotle saying that "no man is willingly bad." However, if we consider that man is the source of his own actions, how can this be true? A common argument is that man is not responsible for what seems "moral" to him, but clearly everyone must be responsible for their own morals. If they are not, morality would not exist at all. And therefore people are responsible for their morals following the doctrine of the mean.<br></p><div class="ad">
