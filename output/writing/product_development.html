<h3>My Notes on Austin Gunter (<a href="https://twitter.com/austingunter">@austingunter</a>)'s talk on Wordpress Product Development</h3>

<h2>
Four Steps
</h2>
In order to integrate your product with an end user you need to make it habitual. This means that the usage of it needs to be habit forming. To do this, we follow four main steps:
<ol>
<li>Trigger</li>
<li>Action</li>
<li>Commitment</li>
<li>Variable Rewards</li>
</ol>


<h2>
Trigger
</h2>
There are two main types of triggers - or actions that cause us to want to do something. The two are <em>external</em> and <em>internal</em>. External triggers come from an outside source. We don't like listening to external triggers. Internal triggers, on the other hand, we really like. Internal triggers come from within, and they come for a few reasons:

<h3>The Tribe</h3>
Being popular. People often game facebook to see how many likes they get because they get a certain degree of satisfaction out of it.

<h3>The Hunt</h3>
Mastering something. People play games trying to get better and better at them so they can feel like the master of the hunt.

<h3>Sex</h3>
Need I say more?


<h2>
Action
</h2>
When we talk about action, we're talking about what's required by the user to interact with the product. Think about it. If it took ten minutes to post every picture, or status, would you really use facebook? Especially if those ten minutes were spent filling in forms. Further, even the signup system needs to be optimized for speedy users. Who needs replicated passwords when you can have a reset button later on? 


<h2>
Commitment
</h2>
What are you investing of yourself? If you've got personal pictures and conversations with friends on a site, you're more likely to come back to it later because it feels like you're already invested in it. Personal investments build habits.


<h2>
Variable Rewards
</h2>
When building a rewards system, if the chance of getting a reward is 100% people will lose interest quickly. Similarly, if the chance of getting a reward is 0% people will lose interest even faster. But, if it's somewhere in between, people get a rise out of the chance of winning. So, they keep coming back for more and more.

<h2>
Interviewing Potential Customers
</h2>
To figure out if your product is working, it's really simple. Find 30-50 potential customers, offer to buy them a coffee if they answer your survey, give them 8-10 relevant questions about your product. The potential customers should fit within your target demographic. Some things to consider with demographics:
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Information <em>relevant</em> to your product (e.g. job, hobbies, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Potential Interview Questions
</h2>
<b>Trigger</b>
<ul>
<li>When would you use this product?</li>
<li>How does this solve a problem for you?</li>
<li>Are there times you wish you had something to solve this problem?</li>
</ul>
<b>Action</b>
<ul>
<li>How hard was the product to use the first time?</li>
<li>Did you have to look anything up to use the product?</li>
<li>Did the product do what you expected?</li>
</ul>
<b>Commitment</b>
<ul>
<li>Would you recommend this product?</li>
<li>(If maybe to above) What would have to change for you to recommend this product?</li>
<li>What did you hate the most?</li>
<li>If it was free would you use it? What about $10 per month?</li>
</ul>
<b>Variable Rewards</b>
<ul>
<li>What did you expect from the product?</li>
<li>How did it live up to your expectations?</li>
<li>What unexpected thing happened?</li>
<li>When you were finished, did you achieve what you wanted?</li>
</ul>

Conclusion

So there are my notes on the talk <a href="https://twitter.com/austingunter">@austingunter</a> gave here at <a href="http://twitter.com/#wcto2013">#WCTO2013</a>. Shoot him some questions if you have any about the talk. The talk video should be online pretty soon, and I'll post a link when it is.<div class="ad">
