    <article> <h1>In the Beginning...</h1><p>Humans used to be apes. We're going to assume that evolution is true because scientifically it has been proven - whether religion agrees with this or not is an entirely new discussion. Since we used to be apes, we still have ape-like wants. When we see members of the other gender with "optimal" organs for having children, we want to have children with them. We want food all the time, because we used to have to go for days without food so when there was a surplus of fatty foods we would gorge ourselves. Should we listen to these urges, or should we attempt to ignore them?<br></p><h2>Excess</h2><p>Excess is having too much of something, or doing something too much. Excess is eating multiple family size bags of chips and a cake because you wanted them. Excess is also living to party; going out every night and drinking, sleeping with multiple people over a short period of time. Excess is unhealthy because it does not consider what is good for more people; it considers only what is good for you.<br></p><h2>Defect</h2><p>Defect is effectively the inverse of excess. Some examples of traits in excess and defect are: (Vanity, Humility), (Boastfulness, Self-depreciation), (Bashfulness, Shamelessness). We see that defect can be excess of a bad thing.</p><h2>Doctrine of the Mean</h2><p>What is the mean? In math, the mean is the average of a set of numbers. In Philosophy, the mean is the average of excess and defect. The mean of vanity and humility is self-respect, bashfulness and shamelessness is modesty, etc. Aristotle believes that for one's character to be truly good, one has to follow the doctrine of the mean.</p><p>So back to the original question, should we control our natural impulses. Aristotle tells us to take the mean - sometimes, natural impulses are right and sometimes they are wrong. We must consider what is best for more people when we decide whether or not to follow impulses.<br></p><div class="ad">
