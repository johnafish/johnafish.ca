    <article> <h1>Decisions: Track vs Science Fair</h1><h2>Track</h2><div>Is and always has been a big part of my life. Since I was a child I've had aspirations of making the Olympics one day, setting world records. Haven't we all?</div><div><br></div><div>Naturally when I went to high school, I joined the school track team. I had decided that I was suited for middle-distance running: 400m/800m. To be blunt, that track season changed my life. I had just come off a string of bad experiences, and needed something positive in my life. I ended up coming in <a href="http://www.windsortiming.com/LiveResults/2014/OFSAA/index.php?Day=Results/140605F006.htm">third</a>&nbsp;at OFSAA (provincials--equivalent to a state meet) in quite the surprise to myself.</div><div><br></div><div>Track gave me footing in my social life and built my self confidence. It made me a better person and it showed me that I have opportunity to be truly great.</div><h2>Science Fair</h2><div>Started off for me in grade seven. In the gifted class, we were expected to make projects. I was not exactly the top science student in my first couple of years, my projects lacked maturity and development. I spent grades seven and eight watching some of my best friends make it to the national fair while I received mediocre awards at the regional level.</div><div><br></div><div>Last year, I was dedicated to my goal of making nationals. I still believe that my project on ZnO nanoparticles was quite impressive, but I was heartbroken to only receive a silver medal at regionals and not progress to nationals.</div><div><br></div><div>Needless to say, this year I wanted quite desperately to make the national fair.</div><h2>GPS Footprint</h2><div>Was the name of my 2015 project. It's a BlackBerry app that tracks carbon emissions based on GPS data from your phone. It computes the distance travelled and calculates the carbon emissions for your method of transportation. For more information, you can check out the app's&nbsp;<a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/59957063/?lang=en&amp;countrycode=CA">posting</a>&nbsp;on the BlackBerry world.</div><div><br></div><div>The project received a gold medal at the regional fair, as well as best in division for "Earth and Environmental Science". It received an "Award of Merit", which means I was being offered an all-expenses-paid trip to Fredericton for the national fair. That's right, I had finally qualified.</div><h2>Except</h2><div>The week of nationals was the week of WCSSAA. For those of you who are unaware of the track qualifying system, you must qualify through WCSSAA to go to CWOSSA to go to OFSAA regionals to go to OFSAA. There is no other way to get to OFSAA.</div><div><br></div><div>Accepting the trip to Fredericton means that I would be rejecting any chances of returning to OFSAA. I discussed this with my coaches beforehand. I was told</div><blockquote>Science fair doesn't lead anywhere, the only people who do science fair are those with too much free time.</blockquote>And<blockquote>School track doesn't matter; you can just run club track. Put your future first.</blockquote>As you can tell, these pieces of advice conflicted with each other a little bit. On one hand, I'm being told that science fair doesn't matter; on the other I'm being told that school track doesn't matter.<h2>The Decision</h2><div>Came down to the fact that there was a chance of me being able to do school track and science fair. My coaches suggested I appeal to the CWOSSA executives - appeals for worse reasons had been won before. After all, I was applying to a subset of an organization with the motto:</div><h3>Education through sport.</h3><div>The message I wrote was simple. I brought up past times and times I had run in the last week. I mentioned how it was impossible for there to not be any empty lanes: there are 18 qualifiers to CWOSSA and it is run on an 8 lane track. While one might imagine they would run three heats of 6, they actually ran two heats of 8 and one heat of 2. I offered to be put in any of these heats, in any of these lanes.</div><h3>Just let me run.</h3><h2>The Result</h2><div>I received this email while in Fredericton:</div><blockquote>Hi John: <br><br>Thank you for your e-mail. I have read it and discussed your situation with members of our CWOSSA Executive. We all understand your situation and recognize that you have a very difficult decision to make. Over the years, many student-athletes have had to face similar situations where school events have conflicted with sport events. In most cases, the students chose to continue with the school component which prevented them from competing either at their local association events, CWOSSA or OFSAA. We also respect your desire to put academics first, which is what being a student-athlete is all about. <br><br>Unfortunately, CWOSSA cannot grant you an expemption [sic] for Track and Field. We hope that you have an amazing and worthwhile experience in Fredericton.<br><br>If you have any questions, pleaese [sic] feel free to e-mail me or call me at 519-843-2500 ext 506. <br><br>Sincerely <br>Jeff Brubacher CWOSSA President</blockquote>Your judgement may be different from mine. I personally am incredibly unimpressed that I was not given any justification for the denial of my appeal. Furthermore, I am questioning of the underlying themes of school track. Are we truly teaching teenagers to be student-athletes, or are we teaching them to be focused on a single facet of their life?<div><h3>Why must we force unnecessary ultimatums on students achieving at high levels in multiple facets of their life?</h3></div><div>Growing up involves making difficult decisions. I knew the possible outcomes entering into this situation. I knew that I may not be able to run. But it truly feels discouraging to have coaches who were once mentors hardly acknowledge me now that I'm no longer a potential OFSAA medalist for them.</div><div><br></div><div>I have no personal grudges with the CWOSSA executives, nor with the WCSAA executives. I am aware that what I'm asking for is an exemption from rules, which by no means are they "legally" obliged to grant. I am just disappointed that I will not be able to perform in a sport I had been training for ever since OFSAA 2014, simply because of semantics.</div><div class="ad">
