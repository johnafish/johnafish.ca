    <article><br> <h1>Alexander the Great<br></h1><p>Is forever immortalized through legend and lore as one of the finest political minds to walk this earth. Alexander founded more than 20 cities, many of which hold his name (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria)</a>. Alexander began his reign as a teenager - his father died at 16, and Alexander inherited the kingdom at this time. What is not commonly mentioned is the fact that Aristotle was the tutor to Alexander - composing for him works on politics and ruling that prepared this ruler to be one of the best of all time.<br></p><h2>Their Introduction</h2><p>Aristotle and Alexander were introduced through Aristotle's father - Philip of Macedon, who was in many ways a great ruler himself. However, he was lacking some of the genius that was in Alexander. Aristotle was asked to be the tutor of Alexander, and he accepted. The fact that Aristotle would seek to be associated with Macedonia even after being persecuted earlier for his connections with them is somewhat surprising, but it's evident through much of his work that he felt rulers should be aptly trained.</p><h2>The Teaching<br></h2><blockquote>"Little or nothing is known of the education imparted by him to his distinguished pupil."<br>Sir David Ross, Page 4, "Aristotle"<br></blockquote><p>Even though we know very little about what Alexander was learning, we can guess based on typical Greek education. Homer would have been a large subject of study, as well as the Iliad. Aristotle also composed multiple works for Alexander as he became more ready for advanced teaching - one on Monarchy, and one on Colonies. <br></p><p>We can see that through these works, Alexander became one of the greatest kings and the greatest colonizer in Greek history, much of which can be credited to Aristotle.<br></p><h2>Later Influences</h2><p>Once Alexander was king, Aristotle's job as tutor was over. While Aristotle and Alexander were still in contact, they were not nearly as close as before. Arguably the most influence that was had on either of one from the other after Alexander's education was the funding of Aristotle's school. When Aristotle wanted to found his own school of philosophy, he called upon Alexander who gave him large amounts of funding. The exact amount is hard to say, because it has been exaggerated over the years, but it was enough for a foreigner to rent buildings and form an incredible museum. <br></p><h2>To Conclude</h2><p>Aristotle was truly an incredible influence on Alexander, and Alexander on Aristotle. When two great minds exist at the same time in such a close proximity, it is no surprise that we see some of the greatest ideas and the greatest military successes of all time.<br></p><div class="ad">
