    <article> <h1>Goodness</h1><p>Goodness is defined (by dictionary.reference.com) as:<br></p><blockquote>"The state or quality of being good."; "moral excellence; virtue"<br></blockquote><p>This article will be looking at Aristotle's thoughts on the second definition of goodness, or the intangible quality of an act being good. We will be exploring this by looking at how he talks about actions being moral and how actions can be good.<br></p><h2>Morality</h2><p>Aristotle approaches morality with an almost mathematical approach: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one. That is to say that an action is moral if it will benefit more people than the alternative actions. A common introductory problem to philosophy is can be written as follows:</p><p>You are walking by train crossing when you see that the train is headed towards a cliff. On its current path, it will fall off the cliff and kill everybody in the train - hundreds of people. However, you see there is a switch that will move the train from its current pathway to one where there is a parade going on, and it is sure to kill tens of people if it goes that pathway. Do you hit the switch?</p><p>Immediately, if you are following the principal mentioned earlier in this section you would say "yes"; more people will benefit from the train going through the parade than off the cliff. Mathematically, it makes sense. But what if someone at the parade is somebody who would have saved thousands of lives? What if there is a future mass murderer on the train?<br></p><h2>Indetermination</h2><p>These questions lead us to the conclusion that, ultimately, the results of an action are indeterminate. That is to say that there is no way of knowing when you flip the switch whether it is ultimately moral or immoral. If we accept this, how can we ever act truly morally? Does this not defeat the concept of trying to be good, when every action has the potential to be ultimately bad?</p><p>To think about this, we have to know that Philosophy is not an exact science. Sir David Ross explains this as follows:<br></p><blockquote>"...impossible to say with precision which actions will produce the best results; but the science that is affected by this is applied ethics or casuistry, the attempt to say what we ought to do in given circumstances, not abstract ethics, which enquires what 'ought' means and why we ought to do what we ought to do."<br>Page 189, Aristotle<br></blockquote><p>That is to say that Aristotle does not necessarily have the answers to these circumstances. We should not attempt to answer these questions simply because we have a definition for morality; that is not enough to answer it. It is an entirely different science to answer these questions.<br></p><h2>Goodness</h2><p>We can derive a definition for goodness from our definition of morality. A good action is an action which is made with the intention of benefiting many, or an action that is immediately perceived to be moral. Although the action could potentially not be better for more people in the long run, it can not be said that it is a bad action. For how else can we act, except for things which appear to be immediately moral. We see an example of this in the fictional novel "Ender's Game".</p><p>In Ender's Game, the protagonist Ender is tasked with "saving the world" from an alien species. He ends up destroying them thoroughly, but later realizes that it would have been possible to coexist with the alien race. He killed billions of intelligent beings. But was this a bad action? He was acting in the best interest of society at the time; they believed the aliens were hostile and that the aliens wanted to wipe out humanity. So Ender acted in goodness, though his actions were ultimately detrimental to more people.</p><h2>Difficulty</h2><p>It is truly difficult to say for sure whether an action is moral or not. Philosophers struggle with these questions to this day, but Aristotle introduced some high level concepts that make legitimate sense and are still applicable to this day.<br></p><div class="ad">
