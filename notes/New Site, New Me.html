<h1>#NewSiteNewMe</h1>
<p>Back at it again with a new site. The old one I hadn't touched in about a year, and hadn't written significant content for in about a year and a half. I think the major reason behind this was that I was using home-half-baked solftware to run the site, which is never a great idea.</p>
<p>I rewrote the site this afternoon. It's feature-bare, which I'm fond of. Every article is a markdown file that is parsed in python and generated to HTML. This has the big advantage of being able to write in any editor that I want, offline or online, and easily generating my site quickly. I called my previous static site generator <code>trout</code>, and I'm gonna stick with that. I'll further develop <code>trout</code> once everything is all put together, but for now it's just styling and generating content.</p>
<p>I want to use this website to display video content and code content. That means that I have to have a robust method for displaying YouTube videos, and a robust method for integrating GitHub content. I have the YouTube part figured out, but I'm still not sure about the GitHub stuff--we'll deal with that when we get there, I guess.</p></article>
