<h1>My Gear</h1>
<p>This is a list of the stuff that I use in my YouTube videos. If you buy anything by clicking these links, I make money from the Amazon Associates program.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about any of my other stuff, <a href="http://johnafish.ca/social.html">get in touch</a> and I'll be sure to update this page!</p>
<h2>Video Gear</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zjn71B">My Camera: Sony a5000</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The sony a5000 is the starter camera in Sony's alpha lineup, and it's awesome. I've loved using it. One huge advantage that it has over the pricier a6000 and beyond series is the flip up screen. If you plan on vlogging, a flip up screen is almost necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zj2GSh">My SD Card: Sony 32GB Class 10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It works. Enough said.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zjxp1H">My GoPro</a></li>
</ul>
<p>GoPros are generally pretty overpriced. This one is not. Having a tiny camera that you can carry around anywhere you go is super useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2CMK0da">My GorillaPod</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely invaluable. I take 95% of my shots using this. It seems pricey, at $50, but the quality is there and I wouldn't trust a knockoff brand for this.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2B0qZH7">My Microphone</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that having a quality microphone is super important. If you plan on taking any calls, doing any voiceovers, doing anything really, the onboard microphones on your phone/laptop/camera are just not good enough. $50 is a bargain for high quality audio.</p>
<h2>School Gear</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2Ctt7TR">My Pencil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used to hate spending more than $0.25 on a pencil. What's the point, right? Wrong. I bought my first kuru toga over a year and a half ago, and have used it to write the most important tests/exams of my life. It's beautifully weighted and the lead stays sharp. I'm a big fan of this pencil. For $10 it's a steal, to be honest. Investing in quality supplies is something you have to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BBPTwg">My Notebook</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Leuchtturm makes simple, no nonsense, high quality notebooks. This is the best notebook that I've ever used--better than any moleskine, for sure. I use it every day, and it cost me less than $20. Definitely worth it.</p>
<h2>Personal Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2qh0Xud">My Watch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have gone through maybe 5 of these Fitbits over a few years. They've been really good to me, I'm just really hard on them since I've worn them 24/7. They're feature-complete (GPS, accurate heart rate monitor, GREAT battery, sleep tracking, etc.) and you can sometimes snap them up for a really good deal.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2E1lIfx">My Phone</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Oneplus 3 is now a couple of generations behind, meaning it can be had for a really good price. Does it hold up though? Yes! I honestly prefer the form factor to my roommate's Oneplus 5, and it has huge advantages over iOS. I've had mine for quite some time now, and I have no regrets at all.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2CPjhNB">My Diffuser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's cool looking, nicely made, and not super expensive for the quality. Holds a fair bit of water! Doubles as a humidifier.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2CPjhNB">Nuun Tablets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I love putting these in my water to get some extra vitamins and to rehydrate. This is a huge deal as well -- around 50% off what you'll find in most stores. 50/50 caffeinated/uncaffeinated I find is a good mix as well, with good flavors.</p></article>
