<h2>Recently,</h2>
I've been slacking off on my site. I don't think I've actually touched it in 2014, which is pretty sad. I'm going to be adding a bunch of new features, and hopefully a new design. So keep an eye out for that.

<h2>New Posts, pls?</h2>
For english class we're keeping blogs. Given that I kind of already have one, I'll be posting articles on here more frequently that pertain to english.

<h2>New features????</h2>
Yes, new features. There is now a comments system in place, as well as a snazzy new articles page. I have some plans for a dramatic redesign, etc, but those things take time. Expect it though, eventually.
