Back to School
Time for reorganization and reflection.
 <h1>Back to School</h1><div>It's the most wonderful time of the year, again. School! It's fair to say that this is one of the times in the year where it makes most sense to organize your life. Summer can get pretty hectic, and if you don't take time to slow down and regroup that wildness follows you into the school year. Here are my "new years resolutions", public for everyone to see:</div><div><br></div><b>Compete in as many hackathons as I can.</b><div>This year, I'm competing in <a href="http://hackthenorth.com/">hack the north</a>&nbsp;for the first time. I also participated in&nbsp;<a href="http://techretreat.ca/">tech retreat</a>, and am going to be at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.waterloo.ca/codefest/">waterloo codefest</a>. My goal is to work on my development skills and develop&nbsp;projects with meaning.</div><div><br></div><b>Work hard, rest hard.</b><div>I plan on working harder than ever this year in school. While I've been pretty happy with my achievements before, this year I want to blow everything out of the water. This means I need to also give myself time to rest, so I want to make a commitment to getting more sleep.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Less social media.</b></div><div>Social media is a weird thing for me. Spending hours on your phone feels restful but, at least for me, does nothing to recharge my mind and body. While I'm not going so far as I have in the past in deleting social media accounts, I will be spending significantly less time on these sites.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Commit to running.</b></div><div>I'm making a commitment to running as my primary sport, as I have for the past two years. This year my main focus will be on the 800m during track season, cross country is going to be just part of my base training for that.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Be a better person.</b></div><div>This is kind of a broad thing to say, but I think it's important. I want to focus this year on doing things that help people around me, not just help myself. I'm going to continue striving to be a better person.</div><br><br>
