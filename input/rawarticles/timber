Timber
The winning hack of #WaterlooCodeFest
 <h1>Timber</h1><div>We live in a world full of people that need to branch out. Everyone is so busy getting poplar on social media that their eyes can't even leaf their screen for one second to check out the beautiful trees around them.</div><div><br></div><div>All of our interaction with technology is done in a digital-to-digital format. You can sit at your home in your underwear and talk to somebody on the other side of the world, which is pretty amazing - but there's a significant drawback to this. People are going outside less. This results in psychologists coining phrases like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_deficit_disorder">nature deficit disorder</a>, which is a phrase that Richard Louv started to use in his research. The data is pretty clear: the more time you spend on your screen, the less time you spend in nature.</div><br><div>But... what if things didn't have to be like this? What if there was a way to connect nature with technology in a way that's both beneficial to individuals but also to the city that they live in?</div><div><br></div><h3>That's where timber comes in.</h3><div><br></div><div>Timber is a social network based around trees. Here's how it works:</div><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lHIf6d5Fs8nvFzJ5mEuxK5mE3b7fXfPCrIVtjA6LxPqgCFYzvKcE7JJmbnHfBg_hJhGhYczq9YJj-7xVgryMRRLe4pC3luO2eI4-vyBJNAoEyZL1mqQ27bDKbFRD6dID1-kD8qlS666qyOubMJKaxQx599oNC4aU_jVg-Em8VgtsNDS98sbpO1BtlrQo46O588sbipk6bQgAYosRu3Cyz-yMcR6jo8HJpz2yNf1_3T1zEh04piPoKwRYc3xgWtHBnQmBBQy7JIEPWf0rTt4zUSn6ZhRu2P37JCcaz72JaLcA7Ge-UowQLbOPMsj_5a1ZnZwK_yDTGEsjmMlNUsHyaucf6B-qJFXmsqY9UVF2nmG5m3_pXYp2LarnlC8EPzCEtWYicaoJtRfYU1PS0X504l8XcPea7qGFt0DAOd2uWXSTivy3XHRjt_5B7RdjVcQjISbY_x-xOzb3iZpenwDeHm0DZvp41vLKeDUOSprT9keuHS9EUkExEJZrRNL6M0I_1cRwKNX7nc3P03uTgT3WOrrYJR2TRE81cRTWT7pGK78=w378-h643-no"><div>This is the homepage of timber. It's a pretty simple design, but let me explain the key features you're looking at:</div><div><br></div><div>The blue dot is you, and it moves around on the map based on your current position.</div><div><br></div><div>The green dots are trees in the database (the Waterloo data set that we used had ~90000 of them).</div><div><br></div><div>The dialogue in the bottom that reads "Hackers / John Tree" pops up when you're within 10m of a tree. Obviously, this is a fake tree that we used for testing purposes, but the real tree dialogues read: "Species / Address". On this dialogue, there are upvote and downvote buttons that you can press to either vote up or vote down the tree, increasing or decreasing its score.</div><div><br></div><div>When you click on a tree, or click on the dialogue, the following screen shows up:</div><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AI1jvXvLPuJgFTzXMDDAxOYTJDADfjcpk93pQ-_2AARXeKxCI8KtIzjIgOMVkZOInqS7KcOK9ebIH6evEWBp_i5UgyQFRdr1YOkewik7Kg9IrjSZWI9lc6TIdu_8pnMrt33epxGvIs6hOCmeNElwIzjF8R--aS1WPFpICMNq4vg0UJWiBI3Q1-ENLT7JFSSjuM3AZIQwX_3lRnR7VmZqN3tcDZ1CSHhOhBgWSDrGWMb8Li2b0iG_5u9NmMNtCh83cTKgdLYDGSmMGY5Z6dibYcFAZBWXUAxk9Ky6B05a3mK4h0KxIn6kGO9CPoDXq3D_FxJtUeBm-EjRWihuj0Z403ryXM-8634Ero3vBQLwrrfoC9v5y4KKX88StSXN1Dp9eHG_TXWQ1fFlvozF2s9WMs5--_4_XjLNk098tMijCG_7TeGZwFn_yiE_s-AK3GRwv8nxv1ZAP9_0Hhy7ipF-2sRSIHPp2P0YVvAoqV-fQh3vVa2aKNm_KHO891eHd0cYtlZXA7TbiLggnhYmpxBBqIGwbHfRid0qYudqj2Fk30s=w378-h643-no"><div>On this page, it shows the type of tree, the address (same as dialogue) the score of the tree (from upvotes/downvotes) and also two pretty interesting buttons. Let's talk about the first button: "Make a Treetup".</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h2>What is a Treetup?</h2><div>A Treetup is a meetup at a tree. You specify a date and time, and timber generates a permalink for you to the Treetup. It's really that simple. You can tweet, or otherwise share the&nbsp;<a href="http://timberapp.ml/treetup.php?time=1445893201&amp;tree=10">link to a Treetup</a>,&nbsp;and anyone who clicks that link will be taken to a webpage showing directions from your current location to the location of the Treetup.</div><div><br></div><h2>Ok, but how does this help the City?</h2><div>Glad you asked. Remember the other button? The other button, flag it, turns this social network into a social crowdsourcing application for the city. Let's say you notice that a tree is diseased, or that it's obstructing a path, or that a massive limb has fallen down and needs to be cleared. Do you know how to report this to the city? We didn't.</div><div><br></div><div>Any user can flag a tree, and it sends an email to the City (well, right now it just sends an email to me) with an address, latitude, and longitude coordinates of the tree that needs to be checked out.</div><div><br></div><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><div>This app could be used for theoretically any municipally managed resource. Trees are a great one, but let's say that you want an app where users can rate public washrooms for cleanliness, or report graffiti on buildings. The code we wrote for timber could just as easily be applied to any of these things. And that's where we go from here, making municipally managed data easily accessible to users, and making the feedback from users easily accessible to the city.</div><div><br></div><div>Timber was written by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/johnafish">me</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/georgeutsin">George Utsin</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/foleyfactor">Alex Foley</a>&nbsp;at Waterloo CodeFest 2015. It's written in HTML5/Javascript with a Firebase backend. That means that the app works on iOS, Android, Blackberry OS, Windows Phone, and whatever else can run HTML. I wrote the backend and all the backend integration, some of the mapping,&nbsp;and the permalink generator/permalink site.</div><div><br></div><div>Here's the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/johnafish/timber">code</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Oh, and one last thing! Did I mention we won the hackathon?</div>
