New Features??
New features have just been added to the website. Take a look!
 <h1>New Features</h1><p>Every website needs to have some pretty sweet features. My website was featureless until recently, not because of a lack of programming skill or creativity - just inspiration and time. However, I justified working on this site some more because of English. So I now introduce to you some pretty sweet new features.<br></p><h2>Real CMS Behavior</h2><p>Previously, I was calling trout a content management system (CMS) without actually having a lot of the behavior that a CMS has. Specifically I didn't have a graphical editor. I found myself to be writing articles in code. Code and writing don't really mix very well.</p><p>I've now written a little web app that has all the features I need to write articles to the website. And it's graphical. Wow.<br></p><h2>Article Categorization/ Sorting</h2><p>I decided that it was about time that I start to categorize articles. Doing this ended up with the cool little icons you can see next to the article list on the writing page. Neat, huh? Well, it also allows me to sort them by topic. So, if you want to read just code articles you can do so. Awesome.<br></p><h2>Coming soon...</h2><p>There are plenty of more features coming soon, but my focus right now is going to be on the graphical editor - got to get it fully up to snuff. However, this article was written in the editor, I just need to add some tools for links, images, etc. Get ready for some content-rich articles. See you in a while!<br><blockquote>"This is a quote"-Sir David Ross</blockquote></p>
