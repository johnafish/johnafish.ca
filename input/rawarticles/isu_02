The Influence of Plato on Aristotle
Two philisophical titans and their influence on each other.
<br><h1>Plato</h1><p>Is one of the founding fathers of modern philosophy. Aristotle, on the other hand, was Plato's student and arguably his successor as the face of philosophy. This article will discuss the influence that Plato had on Aristotle in the book "Aristotle".<br></p><h2>First of all,</h2><p>We can pretty clearly see that Aristotle did not begin a philosopher. This makes sense, as very few people could claim to be born into philosophy. In an article I wrote the other week, we discussed how Aristotle's early life lead him to Plato's school. However, at the time, Aristotle need not have been interested in philosophy, or even science. Plato's school was simply the best place to go. However, while there, it can be said without a doubt that Aristotle began his true endeavours in the field of philosophy.<br></p><h2>Early Schooling</h2><p>It was the early school life of Aristotle where he truly flourished under Plato. Now, to be fair, "Early" is a subjective term because Aristotle was there for 19 years. However, Plato caught on to the brilliant scientific mind of Aristotle - describing him as "The Thinker" and "The Voice of the School". It's interesting to consider how high praise like this might have affected Aristotle.<br></p><p>It's my opinion that Aristotle truly realized his potential due to this praise. Praise given out by mentors can have different effects on different types of people, but in the case of Aristotle it more than likely developed his confidence to the point where he became comfortable in disagreeing with Plato. In fact, this praise helped to elevate him to the level of Plato.<br></p><h2>Later Schooling</h2><p>Later on in the school life of Aristotle, once he had begun to formulate thoughts that disagreed with those of Plato, their relationship became slightly less "vibrant". Plato, while still respecting Aristotle, likely had some feelings of betrayal. And Plato wasn't the only one, many of his students were known to call Aristotle insolent.<br></p><h2>Death of Plato</h2><p>When Plato died, Aristotle left the Platonic school because he was unhappy with the successor. To quote Sir David Ross:<br></p><blockquote>"...Aristotle was most dissatisfied - in particular to its tendency to 'turn philosphy into mathematics'.<br>Page 2, "Aristotle"<br></blockquote><p>In fact, the greatest influence that Plato had on Aristotle was his death, because it allowed Aristotle to pursue his own endeavours without the risk of being persecuted for insolence.</p><p>That is not to say, however, that Aristotle was by any means uninfluenced from Plato other than this. But science is a field of study that builds on the shoulders of giants, and it just so happened that the giant who Aristotle was trying to build on wasn't just dead yet. And so when he died, Aristotle began crafting some more modern views of philosophy.<br></p><h2>So There You Have It</h2><p>I could go through specific examples of Aristotelian philosophy and Platonic philosophy being similar, but this would be redundant. There would be more similarities than dissimilarities. Aristotle did not re-invent philosophy, he simply re-imagined certain aspects of it. Plato was a huge influence on Aristotle because he put Aristotle on the path to future success. And that, my friends, is how Aristotle was so vastly influenced by Plato.</p>
