Preface
</h2>
<a href="http://www.kidsability.com">Kidsability</a> is an amazing group, and they hold a summer camp called <a href="http://www.kidsability.ca/en/fftssummercamps2013">social discovery</a>. I was given the honour to help lead a cooking class under chef Bryan Izzard as part of the advanced <a href="http://www.summerchefschool.com/index.html">summer chef school</a> program. This article is my thoughts and observations on the experience.
</p>

<p>
<h2>
Innocence
</h2>
The first thing I noticed when interacting with this kids at first was a very strong sense of innocence. While this is not uncommon in the age range (8-12), I found that especially so in these kids they had no sense of right and wrong. Unlike other kids, there was no sense of harassment or bullying. I will touch more on their more harsh interactions later.
</p>

<p>
<h2>
Willingness
</h2>
The kids had a huge willingness to learn and to help. As Bryan demonstrated first the breading of the chicken, the room was in stark silence - save the whispers of the counsellors. But it wasn't an incoherent silence, it was a silence of absorption of knowledge. The kids took in every motion that he made, everything that he did. And then they wanted to try it themselves.
</p>

<p>
<h2>
Helpfulness
</h2>
As soon as Bryan was done his demonstration, the kids immediately wanted to try it themselves. They were able to, under the guidance and help of the counsellors, bread their own chicken breasts after making the dredge and the breading. I then popped the chicken in the oven and as we waited, we made two salads as a group.
</p>

<p>
<h2>
Teamwork
</h2>
Making the salads was divided into two teams. The teams had to prepare their vinaigrettes after being given a demonstration by Bryan, and choose which herbs they would like for me to prepare for them (they hadn't been trained on knife safety, obviously, so we couldn't let them prep their own for safety's sake). After preparing the vinaigrettes, they tossed their salads, and we took the chicken parmesan out of the oven.

<h2>
Reactions
</h2>
The kids were a very positive group. Their reactions to the food will never leave my heart. The reactions ranged from "This is a THOUSAND BILLION times better than chocolate!" to "This is the second best thing ever! The first best is grandma's apple pie!" Hearing the joyful, innocent tones made me question a lot of my pre-existing judgements about what it is to be happy. These kids knew how to be happy, and that is something that many people miss these days.

<h2>
Behaviour
</h2>
I observed that the kids generally behaved in one of two ways: passive, or aggressive. The aggressive kids generally were not physically, verbally, or emotionally abusive in any way; they just wanted to make food badly and they only saw their way of doing it. The passive kids generally stepped back, were quiet, and did not interfere with the cooking in any way unless they were explicitly prompted to do so. Neither of these are "better" in any way, they are just two different methods of behaving. However although some feelings were hurt by the aggressive kids, in the end my heart was warmed by hearing them apologize saying things like "_____, I'm sorry for doing what I did," and "sorry that I hurt your feelings, _____."

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
So, to conclude, I had an amazing time teaching at kidsability. My cousin has downs syndrome but he is just a baby, and apart from him my experience with people with a degree of mental disability is very limited. This opened my eyes to see how happy these kids are, despite some of them having some serious limitations on their everyday life. I will definitely make more of an effort to help kids like these more, and I suggest that you do too.
