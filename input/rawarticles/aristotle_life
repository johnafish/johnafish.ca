The (Wonderful) Life of Aristotle
As part of an unofficial series on Aristotle, we are exploring his life and death.
<br><h1>The (Wonderful) Life of Aristotle</h1><p>If you have read my latest ISU posting, you know that this was coming. I've recently been reading a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aristotle-University-Paperbacks-David-Ross/dp/0416681506">Aristotle</a>, written by Sir David Ross, and the first chapter focuses in on his life and works. This will be going over his life, in a brief summary with simpler language than you would find in the book.</p><p>I highly suggest, if you want a more in depth summary of his life, to check the book out at your local library. It's a fantastic book. And now, without further ado, on with the show.<br></p><h2>Birth and Childhood</h2><p>Aristotle was born in the year 384B.C.E., approximately 2400 years ago. He was born in Stavro, a small village in Greece that is now known as <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/preview?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;q=Stagira,+Greece&amp;ei=rEkSVP-hDISsyASH0IGIBw&amp;ved=0CJsBEPIBMA4">Stagira.</a> His father was a friend to the Macedonians, and so he was associated with the Macedonians at an early age (this becomes important later). However, Aristotle was orphaned at a young age and was fostered until the age of 18 when he entered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy#Plato.27s_Academy">Plato's academy.</a></p><p>At the time, Plato's academy was the best in education around. So it isn't very surprising that a brilliant young man like Aristotle would choose to go there.<br></p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy#Plato.27s_Academy"></a><h2>School Life</h2><p>Aristotle attended Plato's academy for 19 years. He was one of Plato's star pupils for a while - being known by the man himself as "The Thinker" and "The Voice of the School". However, as time went on, the inevitable happened and Aristotle began to formulate his own ideas which disagreed with Plato. Many people accused Aristotle of insolence for this, but Plato and Aristotle remained in a respectful relationship.<br></p><h2>Post-School</h2><p>Aristotle left the academy after Plato had died, because the man taking over took Platonic ideas in a direction which Aristotle strongly disagreed with. This point in life was his "lover" phase, because he got married. That wife died, so he had a child with another woman who he was never married to.</p><p>Aristotle was then invited to teach Alexander. He did so for 7-8 years, until Alexander had to take over ruling. Aristotle composed multiple texts for Alexander on politics, and this resulted in one of the most powerful leaders of all time.<br></p><h2>Own School</h2><p>Aristotle founded his own school, with funding from Alexander on the (rumoured) order of 800 talents. That's about $<span class="cwcot" id="cwos">12 480 000USD, assuming a price of $600/kg for silver. This funding is apparently exaggerated, but with the funding he rented buildings, collected hundreds of manuscripts, and a museum of objects to help with his lectures.</span></p><p><span class="cwcot" id="cwos">His school was rumoured to have at least one interesting egalitarian rule, in which every member would lead the school for 10 days (it's unclear what leading the school actually encompasses, but I would imagine think principal).</span></p><p><span class="cwcot" id="cwos">Aristotle did some amazing work at his school, developing many views which are still held today in modern science as well as logic. We don't have very much specific work that happened there, but the influence can be seen all throughout manuscripts and documents of the times.<br></span></p><h2>Post-Alexander and Death</h2><p>When Alexander died, there was an influx of anti-Macedonian behaviour. This means that Aristotle, with Macedonian connections, had to flee the school for risk of being killed. He ran away, and died a year later of a disease which had been ailing him for a while.<br></p><h2>Fin</h2><p>I hope you enjoyed this article on the life of Aristotle. I'm sure that I made multiple mistakes, so feel free to comment the mistakes so that I can (hopefully) fix them. Until the next article!<br></p>
