Spaghetti
The super stupidly stringy starch.
 <h1>Spaghetti</h1><div>Have you ever sat there and wondered</div><blockquote>I wonder what fun things I can do with spaghetti?</blockquote><div>Well, young grasshopper, wonder no longer.</div><div><br></div><h2>The Base Facts</h2><div>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti">the wikipedia page</a>&nbsp;for spaghetti, one half cup (70g) of dry (enriched) spaghetti has:</div><blockquote>110 Calories<br><br>22g Carbohydrates<br>0.5g Fat<br>4g Protein<br><br>1g Fibre<br><br>4mg Iron</blockquote><div>Also according to the Wikipedia page, spaghetti ranges from 25-30cm long. We'll use the average for that range, 27.5cm. We're going to assume that each strand of spaghetti is 3g. This means you are eating about 26 strands of spaghetti per serving. This gives each strand of spaghetti about</div><div><br></div><blockquote>4.23 Calories<br><br>0.85g Carbohydrates<br>0.02g Fat<br>0.15g Protein<br><br>0.04g Fibre<br><br>0.15mg Iron</blockquote><div>Alright, so how much does spaghetti cost? I found you could buy 9060g, 9.06kg of spaghetti for $12.10USD&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webstaurantstore.com/spaghetti-pasta-20-1-lb-bags-case/112SPAGHETT1.html">here</a>. That was the best deal I could find. A little bit of math results in that 9.06kg being equivalent to about&nbsp;<b>129 servings&nbsp;</b>which equates to about&nbsp;<b>3354 strands</b>. This makes each strand cost&nbsp;<b>0.36&nbsp;</b>cents. Alright. We should have the base spaghetti facts. Now for the fun part.</div><div><br></div><h2>If I Were to Only Eat Spaghetti my Whole Life, What Would it Cost me?</h2><div><br></div><div>Probably your life, as soon as you catch scurvy and die.</div><div><br></div><div>But let's ignore you needing vegetables and nutrients, because we've seen people live on just cheese and potatoes before and they turned out just fine. Right?</div><div><br></div><div>According to most doctors, you need different amounts of calories at different points in your life. WebMD has a convenient&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/estimated-calorie-requirement">table</a>&nbsp;for this. The numbers are different for male vs female and sedentary vs active. We will take the average between the genders and assume moderate activity. The table also doesn't include ages 0-2, so I'm going to assume an average of 500 calories per day for that time period.</div><div><br></div><div>The average life expectancy in Canada is 81.24 years. Alright. Time to do the math:</div><br><img src="http://oi59.tinypic.com/iv947n.jpg"><div><br></div><div>Adding it up, we get a total of&nbsp;<b>62 513 275 </b>Cal for the average lifetime. That's&nbsp;<b>568 302.5&nbsp;</b>servings of spaghetti (without sauce). Mmmm. That's a mild&nbsp;<b>14 775 865</b>&nbsp;strands of spaghetti. That's only&nbsp;<b>406336287.5&nbsp;</b>cm or&nbsp;<b>4063.36&nbsp;</b>km long if you laid all the strands end to end. To put that in perspective, walking at 4.5km/h it would take you&nbsp;<b>37 days</b>&nbsp;of continuous walking to get that far.</div><div><br></div><div>The cost wouldn't be that bad either. Because you're buying in bulk, it would only cost&nbsp;<b>$53 193.11</b>. Plenty of room left in the budget for sauces, or you know... things other than spaghetti.</div><div><br></div><h3>Oh, what about cooking the pasta?</h3><div><br></div><div>Let's say you cooked pasta in batches of 19.2 servings - approximately the amount you need to eat every day. After all, nobody likes stale spaghetti. This works out to about 29565 times cooking. We'll be using an 8 quart pot, with 5L of water for our 19.2 servings. Let's find the energy required for boiling this water:</div><div><br></div><img src="http://oi58.tinypic.com/2cwpx7s.jpg"><div><br></div><div>This means that every time we boil water, we're using 1.67MJ of energy. This 1.67MJ is equivalent to 0.44kWh. Thus, for the&nbsp;29565&nbsp;cooking times, we end up using a cumulative total&nbsp;of&nbsp;<b>13 008.6kWH</b>. At $0.09 per kWh, it costs us $<b>1170.74&nbsp;</b>to heat the water. That's again, not too bad.&nbsp;</div><br>What about the&nbsp;135310L of water that we end up using? According to the Canada West foundation, Canadians pay $1.50 for 1 cubic meter of water. This translates to&nbsp;<b>$202.97</b>&nbsp;in total for&nbsp;the water. Again, not too bad.<div><br></div><div>The pot? Let's say we buy five pots in our lifetime, but they're nice pots - $80 a pop. That's&nbsp;<b>$400</b>&nbsp;right there. Oh, we need strainers too. Those last a little better, and they're cheaper, $20 a pop and we'll buy two.&nbsp;<b>$40&nbsp;</b>for that.</div><h3>How much would it cost in total then?</h3><div>Our total cost for the pasta, the electricity, the water, the pots and the strainers comes out to be&nbsp;<b>$54 803.85</b>&nbsp;which is really a pretty sweet deal. This is just over one year of salary for the average Canadian.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, like I mentioned at the start of this section you would probably be dead but pasta is pasta. Mmmm.</div><div><br></div><h2>Hmm... How Much Pasta Would it Take to be Seen from Space?</h2><div><br></div><div>According to Wikipedia, the Palace of the Parliament is visible from space. Obviously this depends on your definition from space, yada yada yada. Let's use it as a basis for what can be seen from space. It has a surface area from above of 64 800 meters squared.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, we need to figure out how many strands of spaghetti it will take. Each strand of spaghetti has the approximate diameter of 1mm and length of 275mm. Therefore each strand has a surface area from above of 275mm squared.</div><div><br></div><div>This means that it will take about&nbsp;<b>235 636 364</b>&nbsp;strands of spaghetti stacked side by side and end to end to be visible from space. That's enough spaghetti to, according to our last section, feed about 16 humans for their entire lives. And it would only cost $<b>848 290.91</b>. A moderate sum to be seen by aliens (also, far less than the $4 billion CAD spend on the palace).</div><div><br></div><b>Anyways, I should probably go study for my exams.</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Side note: All of these numbers are estimates and if you do the math yourself you will get different numbers. This is a great example of Fermi estimation, we're just trying to find the ballpark of these things.</b></div>
