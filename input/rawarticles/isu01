Aristotle: First Impressions
First impressions of the book Aristotle by Sir David Ross.
<br><h1>Aristotle: First Impressions<br></h1><p>Aristotle is arguably one of the greatest minds ever, up there with Plato, Einstein, and Hawking. His ideas about science are still applied today, while his ethics and politics principals resulted in some of the greatest rulers ever. The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aristotle-University-Paperbacks-David-Ross/dp/0416681506">Aristotle,</a> written by Sir David Ross is a book based around his life and ideas. This article is a first impression of the book, along with some of the main ideas presented in the introductory chapters.<br></p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aristotle-University-Paperbacks-David-Ross/dp/0416681506"></a><h2>Tone and Style</h2><p>Every writer has a unique and individual style, and some are easier (or harder) to read than others. This is, of course, the case with Sir David Ross. The book is written in a formal tone, using passages like <br></p><blockquote>"When we pass from the Prior to the Posterior Analytics we pass from the study of the form common to all reasoning to the study of the features which distinguish scientific from dialectical or, as we might say, popular reasoning." <br>-Sir David Ross, Aristotle, Page 41<br></blockquote><p>While this passage is not necessarily difficult to read, it is also not easy to read. Ross can be wordy in his descriptions, but is generally a very accurate and clear writer. This is very important for writers who have a rather obscure topic (like B.C. Philosophy).</p><p>Therefore, it is my opinion that Sir David Ross has an appropriate tone for the topic at hand. <br></p><h2>Personal Impressions</h2><p>I personally picked up the book because I wanted a challenge. I have never read anything on philosophy, and eventually I will be connecting the ideas of Aristotle to some events unfolding in a fictional novel. I believe this is going to be a really fun challenge, and so far I have been enjoying the book. Mind you, it's very slow reading. The slow reading spurs from passages like:<br></p><blockquote>"... it may be suggested that Aristotle thought of the premises in the various figures - 'A predicated of B, B predicated of C', 'B predicated of A, B predicated of C', "A predicated of B, C predicated of B..."<br>-Sir David Ross, Aristotle, Page 41<br></blockquote><p>This is a bit of an unfair example, because it is based on graphical figures which would have been included in the original text of Aristotle's work. Ross admits himself that the terminology is confusing, and goes on to explain what it means. However, personally, reading passages like that can be rather discouraging.</p><p>However, I have learned a lot. I'm only 1/6 through the book, and have already had some pretty interesting ideas introduced. Thus far, it has mainly been discussing basic logic and scientific thought - all of which has been familiarized with me through school. <br></p><h2>Coming Soon...</h2><p>My next few articles concerning this ISU will be concerning the influence Plato had on Aristotle. Be sure to also check out an article I'll be posting soon under writing that summarizes Aristotle's life. Until then!<br></p>
